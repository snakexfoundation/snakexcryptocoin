  <h2>About the Foundation</h2>
  <p>
    The SnakeX Foundation is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
    dedicated to the governance, development, and long-term sustainability
    of the SnakeX ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Foundation supports application-driven digital economies with a focus
    on gaming and interactive digital experiences, prioritizing real utility,
    engagement, and ecosystem resilience.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What is SnakeX?</h2>
  <p>
    SnakeX is a blockchain-based utility token launched on the BNB Chain and
    Ethereum Mainnet. It is designed to function as an application-native
    economic unit within gaming platforms and digital experience environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    SnakeX is not positioned or marketed as an investment product. However,
    as a scarce digital asset, its perceived value may evolve over time as
    the ecosystem grows and adoption increases.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="utility" class="card">
  <h2>Utility & Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gaming platform integrations</li>
    <li>Interactive and digital experiences</li>
    <li>User rewards and incentive mechanisms</li>
    <li>Loyalty and engagement programs</li>
    <li>Access to differentiated features and experiences</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All utilities are optional and designed to enhance, not restrict,
    user participation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Governance & DAO Model</h2>
  <p>
    The SnakeX Foundation operates under a progressive decentralization model.
    Early coordination enables responsible risk management, while long-term
    governance is expected to emerge alongside ecosystem adoption.
  </p>
  <p>
    Governance mechanisms are introduced only when justified by scale,
    participation, and economic relevance.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="technology" class="card">
  <h2>Technology</h2>
  <p>
    SnakeX does not operate its own blockchain or consensus mechanism.
    Security, transaction validation, and finality are inherited from
    established blockchain networks.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>BNB Chain (BEP-20)</li>
    <li>Ethereum Mainnet (ERC-20 compatible)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This design minimizes protocol risk while leveraging proven infrastructure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
  <p>
    The SnakeX Foundation envisions a continuously evolving ecosystem where
    digital ownership, gaming, and decentralized experiences converge through
    practical, application-level utility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future research may explore governance frameworks, interoperability,
    and infrastructure improvements with a strong emphasis on stability
    and transparency.
